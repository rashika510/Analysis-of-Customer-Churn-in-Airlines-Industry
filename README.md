# Analysis-of-Customer-Churn-in-Airlines-Industry
Analysis of Customer Churn in Airlines Industry using R and JSON data set which is the survey data collected by Southeast airlines.

# Goal of the project
Southeast Airlines needs to lower their customer churn i.e. the number of customers
that stopped using its service. The airlines are losing customers as even the loyalty
program is not helping it to retain customers. The airlines need to identify some of the
causes of losing the customers and identify the key metrics which affect the churn rate.
The insights could be used in increasing the customer retention and help the
business.
